I've decided to change careers completely and becoming a Software Developer. Started by trying to learn it all by myself and by watching youtube videos. I had some previous HTML experience when I had to deliver some content to a client in HTML format. (So I dig and learnt a bit).

But I soon realize I would need more in-depth study. Thus, I've enrolled in an HTML and CSS course on
<em>Udemy</em>. Then, together with that, I've enrolled in the Front End Development <strong>TechDegree</strong> at
TeamThreeHouse. I've finished that and enrolled to <strong>Le Wagon</strong> <em>Full Stack Rails Development</em>.


- 🔭 I'm always open to learning new things, and
- 🤓 I'm looking forward to work and collaborate in new projects
- 🏄‍♂‍ Fun fact: Love surfing and snowboarding, also love music and sports in general.
